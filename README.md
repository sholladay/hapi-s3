# hapi-s3 [![Build status for hapi S3](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/hapi-s3/master.svg "Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/hapi-s3 "Builds")

> Use [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) in server routes

Provides an instance of [Scube](https://github.com/sholladay/scube) at `request.server.s3` in route handlers, so you can interact with S3 programmatically.

## Why?

 - Easily implement streaming uploads / downloads.
 - Memory efficient, one instance of the AWS SDK per server.
 - Loads credentials explicitly.

## Install

```sh
npm install hapi-s3 --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const s3 = require('hapi-s3');
```

Register the plugin on your server.

```js
server.register({
    register : s3,
    options  : {
        publicKey : process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        secretKey : process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    }
})
    .then(() => {
        return server.start();
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log(server.info.uri);
    });
```
